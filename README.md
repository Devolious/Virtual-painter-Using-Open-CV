# Virtual-painter-Using-Open-CV
In the decade where everyone is locked in their home and online education is the only way out, my project brings in a cost effective and helpful solution for helping teachers in rural areas and from poor background who can't avail those costly typewriters and present on screen, I have devised a method which involves writing virtually infront of Webcam screen which will be displayed in output screen which can be screen shared and presented to students. My model will act as a virtual writing board for writting and conveying something to viewers.

Along with it can be useful in corporate meets also as one doesn't need anything to visualize a project and can draw using his own hands.It can be used as painting screen for children also which they can use for scribbling and this can be added as a feature in any meeting app which may bring a jovial atmosphere of drawing abstract figures around someone's face. These happiness and helpfulness is all I try to bring through this project.

I did a similar project related to it (Can be found in my repository) in which instead of hand-tracking I used a blue tip to draw but it had certain shortcomings like its quite hard to stop scribbling and cover the tip when not to scribble and was a bit messy too, this project is certainly an improvement over the previous project.
